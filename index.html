					<h2 id="intro_title">My Journey with Autism</h2>
					<p> Published: 2013-9-13</p>
				</header>
					<p class="article">April 2002, I took a secretarial position at the <a href="http://www.adelinelaplantecenter.org/pages/cfHome.cfm/" target="_blank"><strong id="almc">Adeline LaPlante Memorial Center</strong></a> in Wakefield, RI.  During the work day, I would receive visits from the clients we serviced.  They all had their special needs and some were diagnosed the condition called Autism.  Eddie was one such individual.  He would walk around the building everyday around 10am, like clock-work.  He would peek out the doors checking who's cars were in the lot.  He would open the door to any office, stand in the doorway for a minute, check the time on the clock, look at you and walk away.</p>
					<p class="article">Over time I realized what a <em>caring</em> man Ed really was.  He was just absorbing information, organizing where we all were in his mind.</p>
					<p class="article">I learned to prompt Ed to speak and with simple sentences and body language, we began to share worlds.

						<p><strong>Sensory Integration</strong> is the ability to receive information through our senses, process that data and react to our environment. Touch, hearing, sight, taste, smell continuously send information to the brain telling how to react.  This affects our body position, movement and balance.  If the brain false to do this job well, it can interfere with many aspects of one's daily function.</p>

					<h3 id="sub_title">The Senses</h3>
				</header>	
					<div>
					  	<p><strong>The Tactile System</strong> <em>(touch)</em> gathers information about shape, size and texture of an object.  This is how we learn about our surroundings, how we comprehend how next action or reaction.  When you reach into a bag of trail mix in the dark and only want to eat a m &amp; m, you use tactile discrimination.  If this system dysfunctions:</p>	
							<ul>
								<li>Fine motor skills for feeding, dressing, and writing</li>
								<li>Articulation of sounds due to inadequate information from touch receptors in and around the face and mouth</li>
								<li>Visual perception</li>
								<li>Impaired awareness of body scheme <em>(no fear of falling or recognition of danger)</em></li>
							</ul>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p><strong>The Auditory System</strong> <em>(hearing)</em> identifies quality and directionality of sound.  This tells us to turn our heads and look promoting safety.  It also fosters the understanding and production of speech.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p><strong>The Visual System</strong> <em>(sight)</em> Sight is crucial for recognizing shapes, colors, letters, words and numbers.  It is important for reading body language and other non-verbal cues during social interactions.  We continually monitor our actions with our eyes in order to move safely and effectively.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p><strong>The Gustatory</strong> <em>(taste)</em> and <strong>Olfactory</strong> <em>(smell)</em> <strong>Systems</strong> are closely related.  They allow us to enjoy tastes and smells of food and cause us to react negatively to unpleasant or dangerous sensations.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p><strong>The Proprioception System</strong> <em>(body awareness)</em> unconsciously tells our joints and muscles how to move, changing our position and posture.  It will tell us how much force or strength and precision is needed to move and object or use a tool correctly.  Dysfunction in the proprioception can result in:</p>
				 			<ul>
								<li>Slower body movements</li>
								<li>More clumsy movements</li>
								<li>Movements involve more effort</li>
								<li>Difficulty grading muscle force</li>
								<li>Difficulty feeling the weight of objects</li>
								<li>Difficulty planning body movements when preforming gross or fine motor activities</li>
							</ul>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p><strong>Vestibular System</strong> <em>(movement and balance)</em> is located in the inner ear and is the foundation for the development of balance reactions.  It provides information for position and movement of the head in relation to gravity, speed and direction.  When the brain receives the message that the body is falling it activate the muscle groups to maintain balance.</p>
